### Notes
For Sparking/Branding, the following is a helpful way to remember what the follow up mechanic is (after resolving towers):
`[S]`parking -> `[S]`pread\
`[B]`randing -> `[B]`uddies

## Waymarks
All markers mark safe spots during Visceral Whirl.

The `1` and `2` markers are also used by the marked player when dropping Black Hole
