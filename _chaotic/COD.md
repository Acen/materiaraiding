## Notes

```
Magical Classes to soak glowly orbs (they give phy dmg down)

G1 (H1 D1 D3) takes first stack
G2 (H2 D2 D4) takes second stack

Colour WMs to indicate:
Red (A) : DPS Bubble Drop
Yellow (B) : Healer Bubble Drop
Blue (C) : Tank Bubble Drop

*If dps is tight on the tiger on it's second raidwide cast due to mechanics and downtime, Tank LB3 is available to mitigate.
```
