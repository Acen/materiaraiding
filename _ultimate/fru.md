### Buff Timings

## Phase 1: Fatebreaker

Throughout this phase Fatebreaker will aspect his abilities with either Fire or Lightning.

Fire **Cyclonic Break**
: Role-based partner stack.

Lightning **Cyclonic Break**
: Large spread AOEs on each player.

Fire **Strike Break**
: Very strong knockback after the initial hit.

Lightning **Strike Break**
: Line AOE expanding to 2x it's width after the initial hit.

After a few heavy hitting auto attacks, Fatebreaker will cast **Cyclonic Break** which will target each player with proteans.
These proteans will repeat in the position they are baited, and then alternate to the previous safe spot twice.

{% include image.html width="500px" path="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfc624e3-a416-4927-9e3d-5c3b5c22e9c1" %}

For **Fire Aspected** Cyclonic Break, each player will rotate into a pair stack, then alternating between proteans.

{% include image.html width="500px" path="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b066a72-4327-49b0-ab88-39129b02f892" %}

For **Lightning Aspected** Cyclonic Break each player will move into the same proteans but with ranged behind the melee for spreads, then alternate between proteans.

{% include image.html width="500px" path="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ec7b38-c181-4c25-bdba-dded10d78b65" %}

After this resolves, Fatebreaker will cast **Powder Mark Trail**, hitting the MT with a heavy tankbuster and marking them with a 15s debuff of the same name.

Once this debuff falls off, the marked player and the closest ally to them will take a small circular AOE tankbuster.

After the initial hit of **Powder Mark Trail**, Fatebreaker will cast the trio of this phase:

### Utopian Sky

This mechanic can be Fire or Lightning aspected. Fire will result in 2 light party stacks targeted on each healer, and Lightning will result in large AOEs on each player.

Fatebreaker will go untargetable and jump away as fog fills the arena. Party members will spread to the wall in protean positions with ST and D4 swapped. ST and MT will resolve their Powder Mark by moving slightly closer together at the wall.

{% include image.html width="500px" path="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfeb30f-c39a-4031-affe-178f028a58c1" %}

Clones will spawn on each cardinal and intercardinal, but can only be seen when standing next to them. As such all players will walk to the wall within their respective protean position.

While at the wall, 3 random clones will raise their arms, indicating they will cleave through the arena.

Because only the players who are next to these clones can see them, if a player sees a raised arm they will walk to the middle of the arena.

If the person opposite you walks in, **you must walk in as well, even if your clone has a lowered arm**.

This will result in 2 people remaining on the wall and subsequently form a small triangular safe spot. 

Light party 1 will take any safe spot from SW - N

Light party 2 will take any safe spot from NE - S

After arriving at the safespot, the party will either stack or spread. The spread is identical to **Strength** from DSR. 
The DPS can move 3.5 notches from the star on the arena edge to determine a safe distance from the healer.

### Tethers 1

After the spreads or stacks resolve, Fatebreaker will drop into the middle of the room **untargetable** and begin to cast another aspected Cyclonic Break. Another Lightning Aspected Fatebreaker clone will spawn on the West of the arena casting Strike Break. As the proteans resolve, another clone will spawn in the middle of the arena that is either Fire or Lightning Aspected. What is **NOT** aspected here will be the safespot in the upcoming mechanic.

Immediately following the Cyclonic Break, players will either move North or South to avoid the Strike Break. To the north, a Fire Aspected clone will begin to cast Strike Break. At the same time, two random players will be targeted for light party stacks via a **Bound of Faith** cast. 

Light party 1 will move slightly to the north, and Light party 2 will move slightly to the south. If a swap is required, melee will flex as needed. Using the knock back from Strike Break, each party will be knocked North East/West and South East/West depending where the safespot is.

{% include image.html width="500px" path="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca78a90f-ff7d-4d58-a147-8a2496f72c63" %}

If these light parties are not an even 4/4 split, players will be hit with a heavy damage down.

Fatebreaker will then appear in the center of the arena and cast "Burnished Glory", a hard hitting raidwide with a bleed attached.

Following this, Fatebreaker casts:

### Fall of Faith / Tethers 2

Fatebreaker will begin the mechanic by targeting a random player with either a **Fire Aspected** or **Lightning Aspected** Fall of Faith.

3 clones will spawn from NW to NE, each one tethering a new player with Fire/Lightning.

All of the tethers here are randomized. It is entirely possible to get all one colour.

These tethers are slightly different to the previous Bound of Faith mechanics in that **Fire** tethers will launch a large conal light party stack at the nearest player, whilst **Lightning** tethers will launch 3 large conal AOEs on the nearest players.

To resolve this, the party will line up south of Fatebreaker. As the tethers are placed, the 1st and 3rd tether will go to the West of Fatebreaker, and 2nd and 4th tether will go to the East of Fatebreaker. 

The 1st and 2nd tethers will start by placing themselves on the hitbox of the boss, with the 3rd and 4th tethers slighlty outside the hitbox in front of them.

The remaining 4 non-tether players will split evenly so West/East both have 4 players. 

The two most west players will move west group and the two most east players will move to the east group.

As the tethers begin to resolve, players need to pay attention to whether it is a fire of a lightning tether to be in the correct position.

{: .note }
> Because the tether colour disappears quickly on the first tether, it can be useful to commit this one to memory.

Once a tether goes off on each side, the tethered players should swap positions.

After another **Burnished Glory**, Fatebreaker will do anotber **Powder Mark** tankbuster befote casting the final mechanic:

### Burst Strike / Enum Towers

Fatebreaker will begin to channel burst strike and 3 towers will appear on the West or East wall. These towers will require 6 members from the team to soak them, with a maximum of 4 players in one tower.

From North to South, players will pair up in the towers in the order: H1/D1 - H2/D2 - D4/D3.

If a tower only has one pillar, then the D1/D2/D3 will move to the next available tower from North to South.

If Burst Strike is Fire Aspected, players will ride the knockback into their respective tower.

If Burst Strike is Lightning Aspected, players can simply step out into their tower immediately.

{% include image.html width="500px" path="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c9b1b59-d875-4cf2-8455-cc72afa87cce" %}

Whilst this is happening, the tanks will be utilising the opposite half of the arena to resolve their **Powder Mark** debuff in the same manner as the previous tankbusters.

Finally, Fatebreaker will cast his enrage:

### Burnished Glory

## Phase 2: Usurper of Frost

Phase 2 begins with a tankbuster **Quadruple Slap, before starting the first major mechanic:

### Diamond Dust
