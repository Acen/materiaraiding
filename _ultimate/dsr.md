## Fight Writeup (W.I.P)
{: .no_toc }

Guide written by Juno

## Phase 1: Knights

This phase begins with two targetable bosses: Adelphel and Grinnaux.
Once pulled, tanks will stack the bosses and the party will stay south.

{: .damage }
> As Adelphel goes untargetable soon after the phase starts, players should spend their buffs and openers on him. Throughout the phase both bossess should be kept as similar health as possible.

After a **Holiest of Holy** raid wide Grinnaux will cast **Empty Dimension**, forming a donut AOE centered on him. At the same time Adelphel will cast **Holy Shield Bash**, a tethered AOE tankbuster that is targeted on a random player. The MT must walk through this tether and bring it north of the bosses to take the tankbuster **with invulnerability**. At the same time the party will take a **Heavensblaze** stack at the south.

After this stack and tankbuster combo, Adelphel will become untargetable and Grinnaux will cast:

### **Hyperdimensional Slash**
{: .no_toc }

Grinnaux will then target 4 random players with a line AOE. This AOE will drop a purple portal on the edge of the arena wherever it was aimed, and if two portals are too close to one another they will tether to eachother and wipe the raid. Similarly, if a player stands too close to a portal they will become tethered and die.

These 4 players must spread to the north of Grinnaux at max melee, where they will take a line AOE. The positions each player will take are designated by waymarks.

At the same time as the prey markers move north, the remaining party members will stack south of Grinnaux and take a large conal AOE stack that gets baited on a random non-prey player.

_Image taken from Tessan Twintails DSR video guide_

This process repeats twice, where the 2nd set of prey markers will instead spread south and the initial prey players will stack north.


Adelphel will then drop down onto a random cardinal and cast another **Holiest of Holy** and Grinnaux will cast **Faith Unmoving** which will knock players away from Grinnaux (who is still in the center of the arena). Players will use anti-knockback and position themselves so Grinnaux is between them and Adelphel, as Adelphel will then begin to dash across the arena in an hourglass shape.

Adelphel will start this dodge by either moving left or right, and the party will move the same direction and stand on the tip of an arrow shaped pattern in the arena . **(I'll try get a video for this - Juno)**

After completing his dashes, Adelphel will drop onto the player who had the highest emnity on him before he dissappeared, delivering a heavy hitting AOE tank buster that the OT will invuln. To avoid hitting the party with this, the OT will follow the party to the safe spot and then **continue moving past the party**. 

Adelphel will then immediately begin casting 1 of 3 instances of **Holiest Hallowing**, an interruptible heal targeted on Grinnaux. The OT will interrupt this and both tanks will position their bosses in the center of the arena for:

### **Playstation Chains**
{: .no_toc }

Each player will be marked with either a cross, square, circle, or triangle, so that there is two of each symbol. 

{: .note }
> **Healers** can only ever get Cross or Triangle, **Tanks** can only get Cross or Square, and **DPS** can only get Square, Circle or Triangle

The party will form around Grinnaux in the pattern seen below, and be knocked back by another **Faith Unmoving** to break their tethers. If unbroken, the resulting AOE will kill any players who have not resolved their tethers.

![](https://github.com/materiaraiding/materiaraiding/assets/104756079/ada530eb-b49d-4266-92cc-abe22b95df1c)


{: .warning }
> A warning to warrior players; Inner release is perfectly timed in this phase to be up as this mechanic is resolving. This means that you'll be immune to knockback and therefore unable to resolve your tether. You can either prepull inner release earlier in the fight, or simply click the **Inner Strength** buff off during this mechanic.

Immediately after this is resolved, the 2nd **Holiest Hallowing** cast will begin, and the ranged player (or main tank) will interrupt the cast. Both bosses should be stacked middle again for another **Holiest Holy** and either an **Empty** or **Full Dimension**. If it is **Empty** Grinnaux will do a donut AOE around him like before. If it is **Full**, move away from Grinnaux as he will cast a large circular AOE centered on him.

The final **Holiest Hallowing** will be interrupted by the OT again. At this point, if one of them dies before the other, they will begin to cast their enrage: either **Bull's Steel** or **Brightblade's Steel**. As such both bosses must be killed at roughly the same time.

After dropping their health to 0%, they will immediately become untargetable. Grinnaux will then **holmgang** the entire party to the western side of the arena, chaining them in a small circle. Attempting to leave this circle will kill the player immediately.

A new boss **Charibert** will then appear at the southern side of the circle and begin to cast **Pure of Heart**, the enrage of phase 1.

### **Pure of Heart**
{: .no_toc }

**Haurchefant** will run to the side of the circle and block an arrow. This arrow pulses intermittently, dealing damage to the party. 

Charibert will then cleave the two players closest to him, applying a 5s debuff **Skyblind**. Once this debuff wears off, an invisible AOE will drop under the players feet that will explode after a few seconds. To resolve this, we have players bait in the order **H → M → R → T**, where the ranged players will drop their AOEs on the east and the melee players will drop them on the west.

Once Charibert is reduced to approximately ~25-30% health, the DPS check is reached and as long as one player survives the transition the party will receive a checkpoint.

## Phase 2: Thordan

Phase 2 will begin with the MT facing Thordan north for 2 auto-attacks before he will begin casting **Ascalon's Mercy**, a baited protean on every member of the party.
The party will stack up behind Thordan before dodging to the side to avoid the cleave. 

{: .note }
> The tell to move for this attack can either be the end of the castbar, or when Thordan raises his sword slightly.

Thordan will then slash 3 times at the Main Tank with a tank buster **Ascalon's Might**.

{: .tanks }
> Due to the mit plan that MUR PF uses, if the MT is a **WAR** they can use their invincibility here for free.

After moving to the center, Thordan will cast the first trio of the fight:

### Strength of the Ward
{: .no_toc }

Thordan will become untargetable and jump from the arena, and both Light parties will split East/West. 

3 Knights will then cleave 3 random cardinals/intercardinals, leaving only 1 safespot either side of the arena. 

The way that the waymarkers are set up means that **Light Party 1** will always be on a **number** waymark, and **Light Party 2** will always be on a **letter** waymark. Two waymarks on opposite sides of the arena will also be the same colour, allowing us to simply call out a single colour to determine both safe spots. 

![](https://github.com/materiaraiding/materiaraiding/assets/104756079/5b0b7ee8-5211-4406-a75a-f00c5b58e486)

> In the image above we can see the purple, yellow, and blue waymarks have knights on them. Thus we can simply call out "Red" and both parties will know where they have to go.

Within both of those safespots, each light party will have to spread to avoid overlapping lightning AOEs that are about to drop on each player. These lightning AOEs will go off at the same time as the dashes go off.

While the parties are getting into position **Grinnaux** and **Thordan** appear again, with Grinnaux being placed somewhere near the center of the arena and Thordan in the direct center. After everything resolves Grinnaux will begin to cast an earthshaker that will expand out towards each light party. Avoiding this is simple, just waiting until it is safe to walk forward and doing so. 

While the party is dodging this, Thordan will cast another **Ascalon's Mercy**. Each light party must quickly make their way toward Thordan and stack up tightly on either side of him to bait the proteans.

Thordan will then jump again and land on a random cardinal or intercardinal, as well as 2 other knights dropping onto the arena. For this section of the Trio we will treat **Thordan as our new north**. 

{: .note } 
> Thordan can be tricky to find here if you're spinning your camera around. What you should do instead is look at the 2 knights, who will always be further away from and facing Thordan.

3 players will then get marked with a large blue defamation marker (named Skyward Leap), and large red puddles will begin to grow on the ground. Each of the 2 knights will also tether two random non-tank players (who do not have Skyward Leap) with **Holy Shieldbash/Bladedance**.

Everyone who was not marked with Skyward Leap should quickly find Thordan and make their way to him. The Tanks will take their respective tether (MT left knight facing Thordan, ST right knight facing Thordan) and criss-cross them into the safe spot under Thordan to stretch them further for reduced damage. 

![](https://github.com/materiaraiding/materiaraiding/assets/104756079/9ff95bb1-a663-4834-991b-bef741b5e0cf)

{: .warning}
> The relative West and East Skyward Leap players should stand on the **edge of the waymark** as seen in the image. If you stand in the middle of your waymark you are likely to kill one of the Tanks next to Thordan.

Just before everything goes off, 6 towers will appear in the middle of the Arena that must be soaked by every player other than the tanks. 

The 3 non Skyward Leap players should line up against the wall below Thordan to indicate which tower they are taking before standing together for a stack that will be shared with both tanks.

{: .tanks}
> Each Tank can stand in front of their respective knight to ensure they are the one to grab the tether, before using sprint to comfortably make it to the safe spot.

Each player will then walk forward into their respective tower and soak the damage. If one tower is missed a high amount of damage will hit the party, likely wiping the group.

Thordan will then drop into the center of the arena and cast **Ancient Quaga** and heavy hitting raidwide, followed by **Heavenly Heel** into **Ascalon's Mercy**. **Heel** inflicts a **slashing resistance down** debuff, requiring a tank swap.

He will then begin to the cast the next trio of the fight:

### **Sanctity of the Ward**

Thordan will then leave the arena and 2 knights will drop down near the center, on opposite sides to each other. These knights can either be facing clockwise or counter-clockwise, which will determine the way they are about to dash across the arena. A third knight will also spawn on one of the waymarks near the outside of the arena.

The knight at the edge of the arena will then target 2 people for distance-based stacks, indicated by either a single sword or 2 swords above the players head. The player with 2 swords should move _behind_ the third knight, and the single sword player should move to the opposite side of the arena on the same axis as the knight (i.e. if the knight spawns on a blue waymark, the single sword moves to the opposite blue waymark).

Each stack will move 4 notches in the same direction as the knights (CW/CCW). This will leave the party in the 1st of 2 safespots as part of the dashes. After the cleaves go off around them the party will move to 4 notches _before_ the next waymark for the next safe spot.

(Diagram for safespots :3)

After the last AoEs resolve, various knights will appear around the arena alongside thordan, preparing to cast various new mechanics in tandem. This set of mechanics is referred to as:

### **Meteors**

Players should split off into pairs on each of the cardinals as per the cheatsheet (MT/D3 N, OTD4 S, H1D1 E, H2D2 W), standing between the AOEs that have spawned on the intercardinals. 2 players will be marked by "Meteors", a small red arrow above the players head. These 2 players will **ALWAYS** be part of the same role. The role that gets the meteors is deemed as the "priority" role.

The meteor players will position themselves North and South, swapping with the same respective role player that is already positioned there. _Generally_ the meteor players should try and go to N/S cardinal that is **clockwise** of them, however this rule isn't always followed.

Each pair should stand roughly halfway between the centre of the arena and the edge of the arena to bait a set of partner stacks that will leave a puddle of ice that will inflict a short **"Ice Resistance Up"** buff for a moment, allowing you to quickly move out of the puddle before it applies a heavy frostbite DOT. The large orange AOEs on the intercardinals will also turn into fire puddles when the stacks go off, leaving the middle of the arena unable to access the outer ring and vice versa.

While everyone is moving to their positions, 8 towers will spawn. Some of these towers will be on the outer edges and some in the middle of the arena. If only one tower is available on the outer edge of the arena in a pair's quadrant, the **priority role** (i.e. the one with meteors) should take that tower, and the other player should move into the middle of the arena to soak the tower **clockwise** from where they baited their puddle. If 2 towers are available on the outer edge of the arena the **priority role** will take the left most tower, and the **non-priority role** will take the right most. However this rule is a bit flimsy and most often people will just move to the left/right beforehand to indicate which tower they will take.

The meteor players can be a little different with which towers they want to take. The meteor debuff they both have will cause 8 meteors to drop down on them one at a time. If any of these meteors are close to eachother they will explode and wipe the raid. As such, we want the meteor players to be the furthest distance possible from eachother. 

In an ideal world this means that each meteor player will take a tower that results in them being 180 degrees from eachother. However it doesn't always pan out this way as the tower positions are semi-random, resulting in 2 other patterns where one meteor player will be closer to the other, about 150 or 120 degrees. The 120 degree pattern is colloquially known as **"cursed"**.

To avoid these patterns as much as possible, each meteor player will look at the other and indicate to take a tower to give the largest gap between the two. Once you inevitably get one of these patterns, the player on the "short" side, will have to: Follow the curve of the inner AOEs to use up as much space as possible, and if the pattern is cursed employ stutter stepping to pace out the meteors correctly. This can be difficult at first as the meteors will drop very close to eachother. Fortunately this pattern is pretty unlikely.

After the initial tower soak both meteor players will start moving clockwise around the arena. 8 more towers will spawn on each cardinal and intercardinal and after about 5/6 meteor drops **Faith Unmoving** will be cast. All outside players will use **Anti KB**, and all inside players will ride the knockback into their respective tower. The towers each player will take depends on the initial safespot they started from. **Priority** players will take the cardinal tower, and the **Non-priority players** will take the tower **1 clockwise** of the starting safespot. Both Meteor players will end up in the opposite North or South tower.

After these towers are resolved, Thordan will drop down at true north and begin to cast a heavy hittind raidwide: **Ultimate End**. After this, Thordan gains a "discomposed" debuff, causing him to take 30% more damage. He will then cast **Broad Swing** twice in a row at a random player, where the party will stand behind him and move into the first cleave.

Thordan will then cast his enrage: **Atheric Burst**.

## Phase 3: Nidhogg

{: .everyone }
> This phase begins with a HEAVY raidwide attack and should be mitigated appropriately

Nidhogg will drop down and begin auto-attacking the main tank, before casting:

### Dive from Grace

{: .note }
> This mechanic is one of the first "walls" of this fight, and can be difficult to wrap your head around/remember all the roles. I recommend to watch videos of solves and also to review the toolbox above.

As the cast begins, a bunch of numbers will apply to the party:
* "1" x3 (put the symbol here)
* "2" x2 "
* "3" x3 "

Players will preposition in the following locations to indicate their starting position depending on their number.

After the cast is finished (~5 seconds later), a second set of debuffs get applied to each player:
* Dark High Jump (Circle)
* Dark Elusive Jump (Down Arrow)
* Dark Spineshatter Dive (Up Arrow)

The numbers players are assigned are the order that each player will be "dived/jumped" on by Nidhogg: 1->2->3
Whilst the second debuff will be what **kind** of dive/jump Nidhogg is performing.

After getting dived the player will leave behind a tower that needs to be soaked by someone else, as both the dive and the tower inflict a **"Fire Resistance Down II"** and a **"Physical Vulnerability Up"** debuff.

The _type_ of dive that Nidhogg performs will indicate **where that tower is going to be placed.** I think of the arrows as if they _push_ the tower in one direction, i.e. If I were to have an Up Arrow, my tower would be pushed the distance of Nidhoggs hitbox away from me in the direction I'm facing. No matter whether players have arrows or no arrows, we always want to place the towers on the **East/West/South** of Nidhogg's hitbox due to another upcoming mechanic.

OCE uses the **"Easthogg Strat"** I.e. we solve the arrows in such a way that all arrow players can simply face east (as long as they are in the correct position) and the mechanic will resolve.

(Diagram for easthogg arrows)

As seen above we place the **Up Arrow** West, and the **Down Arrow** East. If both these players look east the towers will end up on the sides of Nidhogg's hitbox. If a set of numbers **does not** have arrows, they will use the positions they indicated when the numbers first went out.

The order that the numbers will soak the towers is as follows:

(using their previously indicated positions, or their arrow positions)
* 3s soak 1s towers 
* East and West 1s soak 2s
* 2s and South 1 soak 3s
